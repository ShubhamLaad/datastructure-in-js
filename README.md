udemy DS questions and notes

## Notes
recursions store function in call stack until break points comes then it pop from stack.
Break point: function which run full is pop from stack its not mandatory that it has return statement.
eg: look DFS function of tree


for breadth first use queue
for defth first use stack


// PreorityQueue insert Olog(n) (log base 2 n)
// removal also hv Olog(n)

// PriorityQueue is min binary tree but have node with priority values
// WeightGraph dijkstra algo things learn is priority queue can hve multiple values and try to use diff DS for diffrent types of opration. Like here we use priority queue as well as object for storing distace.
where object only use for storing and with unic value
where priority queue only use for getting sort value here value can be repeatative
